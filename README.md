## Description
This repository hosts my assignment solutions for MATH 305 at UBC Vancouver for the 2020W2 term. All assignments were typeset using LaTeX 
(on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [LaTeX Workshop plugin](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop)).
Diagrams created with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). 

**Note**: Only a few problems from each assignment are chosen to be graded. 

## Academic Honesty and Standards
From the UBC Calender:
> Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.
>
> It is the student's obligation to inform himself or herself of the applicable standards for academic honesty. Students must be aware that standards at the University of British Columbia may be different from those in secondary schools or at other institutions. If a student is in any doubt as to the standard of academic honesty in a particular course or assignment, then the student must consult with the instructor as soon as possible, and in no case should a student submit an assignment if the student is not clear on the relevant standard of academic honesty.
>
> If an allegation is made against a student, the Registrar may place the student on academic hold until the President has made his or her final decision. When a student is placed on academic hold, the student is blocked from all activity in the Student Service Centre.
